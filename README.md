Android library listening available WiFi Access Points and related information with RxJava Observables.

Its functionality was extracted from [ReactiveNetwork](https://github.com/pwittchen/ReactiveNetwork) project to make it more specialized and reduce number of required permissions.

If you are searching library for observing network or Internet connectivity check [ReactiveNetwork](https://github.com/pwittchen/ReactiveNetwork) project.

Library is compatible with RxJava 1.+ and RxAndroid 1.+ and uses them under the hood.

Usage
-----

Library has the following RxJava Observables available in the public API:

```java
Observable<Boolean> observeWifiConnection(final Context context)
Observable<List<ScanResult>> observeWifiAccessPoints(final Context context)
Observable<Integer> observeWifiSignalLevel(final Context context, final int numLevels)
Observable<WifiSignalLevel> observeWifiSignalLevel(final Context context)
Observable<SupplicantState> observeSupplicantState(final Context context)
Observable<WifiInfo> observeWifiAccessPointChanges(final Context context)
```
### Observing WiFi Connection
We can observe WiFi connection with `observeWifiConnection(context)` method.
Subscriber will be called everytime, when WiFi connection On or Off.
We can do it as follows:
```java
new ReactiveWifi().observeWifiConnection(context)
    .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())
    ... // anything else what you can do with RxJava
    .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())
    .subscribe(new Action1<Boolean>() {
      @Override public void call(Boolean boolean) {
        // do something with signalLevel
      }
    });
```
### Observing WiFi Access Points

**Please note**: If you want to observe WiFi access points on Android M (6.0) or higher, you need to [request runtime permission](https://developer.android.com/training/permissions/requesting.html) for `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` or `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`. After that, location services have to be enabled. See sample app in `app` directory to check how it's done.

We can observe WiFi Access Points with `observeWifiAccessPoints(context)` method. Subscriber will be called everytime, when strength of the WiFi Access Points signal changes (it usually happens when user is moving around with a mobile device). We can do it in the following way:

```java
new ReactiveWifi().observeWifiAccessPoints(context)
    .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())
    ... // anything else what you can do with RxJava
    .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())
    .subscribe(new Action1<List<ScanResult>>() {
      @Override public void call(List<ScanResult> scanResults) {
        // do something with scanResults
      }
    });
```

**Hint**: If you want to operate on a single `ScanResult` instead of `List<ScanResult>` in a `subscribe(...)` method, consider using `flatMap(...)` and `Observable.from(...)` operators from RxJava for transforming the stream.

### Observing WiFi signal level

We can observe WiFi signal level with `observeWifiSignalLevel(context, numLevels)` method. Subscriber will be called everytime, when signal level of the connected WiFi  changes (it usually happens when user is moving around with a mobile device). We can do it in the following way:

```java
new ReactiveWifi().observeWifiSignalLevel(context, numLevels)
    .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())
    ... // anything else what you can do with RxJava
    .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())
    .subscribe(new Action1<Integer>() {
      @Override public void call(Integer level) {
        // do something with level
      }
    });
```

We can also observe WiFi signal level with `observeWifiSignalLevel(final Context context)` method, which has predefined num levels value, which is equal to 4 and returns `Observable<WifiSignalLevel>`. `WifiSignalLevel` is an enum, which contains information about current signal level. We can do it as follows:

```java
new ReactiveWifi().observeWifiSignalLevel(context)
    .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())
    ... // anything else what you can do with RxJava
    .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())
    .subscribe(new Action1<WifiSignalLevel>() {
      @Override public void call(WifiSignalLevel signalLevel) {
        // do something with signalLevel
      }
    });
```

`WifiSignalLevel` has the following values:

```java
public enum WifiSignalLevel {
  NO_SIGNAL(0, "no signal"),
  POOR(1, "poor"),
  FAIR(2, "fair"),
  GOOD(3, "good"),
  EXCELLENT(4, "excellent");
  ...
}
```

### Observing WiFi information changes

We can observe WiFi network information changes with `observeWifiAccessPointChanges(context)` method. Subscriber will be called every time the WiFi network the device is connected to has changed. We can do it in the following way:

```java
new ReactiveWifi().observeWifiAccessPointChanges(context)
    .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())
    ... // anything else what you can do with RxJava
    .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())
    .subscribe(new Action1<WifiInfo>() {
      @Override public void call(WifiInfo wifiInfo) {
        // do something with wifiInfo
      }
    });
```

### Observing WPA Supplicant state changes

We can observe changes in the WPA Supplicant state with `observeSupplicantState(context)` method. Subscriber will be called every time the WPA Supplicant will change its state, getting information at a lower level than usually available. We can do it in the following way:

```java
new ReactiveWifi().observeSupplicantState(context)
    .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())
    ... // anything else what you can do with RxJava
    .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())
    .subscribe(new Action1<SupplicantState>() {
      @Override public void call(SuppicantState state) {
        // do something with state
      }
    });
```
